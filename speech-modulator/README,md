Speech modulator uses portaudio to connect to a sound card. For now,
we use the "default" input device, which happens to be the built-in
microphone.

The sound is read-in with a samplerate of 44100, the samples
are passed through a lowpass filter, a rate converter and 
an hilbert filter to create IQ samples.

These samples are passed on to a tcp client who does the
communication to the server - either the iq-server (rpi) or the
"hackrf-transmitter" (the hackrf)

The software is far from complete and under development
